# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to retrieve a user from an array using a user ID passed as a parameter.  The code is missing crucial error handling, causing it to fail if the user ID is not a valid number.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code that includes comprehensive error handling to prevent crashes and return appropriate error responses to the client.
